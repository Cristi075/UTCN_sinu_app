# UTCN Sinu App

This is a mobile application created to check the exam results at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (TUCN, or UTCN in Romanian).

## Why?

I wanted to be able to see that page without having to authenticate and go through multiple menus in the web UI every time.

## How 

This was created using the kivy framework. This way, it can be ran on multiple platforms.
There are lots of things that are not done properly (parsing HTML using regex is just an example) that appeared due to my lack of experience with Android and/or kivy.

## I want to run it!

### Just install it

You can download the APK from the binaries folder and install it on your phone. To do this you should allow the installation of untrusted applications.

### Compile it!

You can also clone this repo and use buildozer or the Buildozer Virtual Machine supplied by Kivy to build your APK.
